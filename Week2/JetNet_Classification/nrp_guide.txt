step by step of how to set up cluster (for my reference)

1. prepare github repo
    * make sure the repo is public or use a token if private 
    * training script (main.py) should run autonomously and save any outputs

2. create a .yaml file
    * template can be found at Week2/template.yaml

3. deploy job
    * commands: 
        kubectl apply -f <name>.yaml -n cms-ml
        kubectl get pods -n cms-ml
        kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n cms-ml

4. retrieve output files
    kubectl cp -n cms-ml <pod-name>:/opt/repo/Deep_Learning_Review_and_Practice/Week2/JetNet_Classification/output ./local-output

5. clean up
    kubectl delete job <job name> -n cms-ml
